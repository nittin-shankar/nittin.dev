Last year, around October, back when I hadn't fixed the name for my podcast and was still brainstorming. I wrote a document titled "Qualification of guests". The reason for writing the document is to remind myself of the kind of people whom I should invite to be guests.

At Talam, the organization that I work with, we have a designated mentor named Abhi. He is volunteering with us to assimilate all our potential offerings and guide us to provide value to our desired target audience. So, it was Abhi who asked me to think profoundly about the qualification criteria and write about it. As soon as I had my draft ready, I scheduled a half hour meeting with him.

On that meeting, my major takeaway from him was to consider using the word **collaborator** rather than **guest**. He further added that the word guest inherently means someone who is going to partake only for that specific event. Their participation on the event ends right after the event does.

After listening to this suggestion, it immediately made sense to change my vocabulary. Because, in essence, I want to co-create the podcast in collaboration with my interviewees. The purpose of each collaboration would be to give my target audience the most value in each episode. I also would like to stay in touch with my interviewees for a long time.

I changed the vocabulary in all my internal documents that I wrote when ideating for the podcast. This allowed me to reinforce the fact that I'm always in collaboration with other people. I believe I'm more open-minded this way. In my mind, it has taught me to be inclusive to the thoughts of my collaborators. it had allowed me to be vulnerable to ask clarifications and seek genuine feedback from them.

The reason that this vocabulary change is working because, collaboration, is a strong word. In the history of human evolution, it might be one of the reasons to achieve significant milestones. We feel happy when we interact with like-minded people and feel respected while creating something new. A collaboration is exactly that.

After someone has agreed to come on the podcast, I make it a point to communicate my internal vocabulary change with them. I see it as a first step to maintain a strong relationship with my intelligent collaborators. My beliefs about interviewees being collaborators get reciprocated back by them. It's almost very apparent immediately. Some of the immediate reactions that I got are:

- "I'm honored"
- "Oh nice"
- "Looking forward to it"
- "Super"

The overall feeling and sense of collaboration that they had was astounding to see. I'll give you a small example from one of my collaborators, Hanurag, from Pondicherry. He is working as a senior UAV engineer working in a startup called YouCanFly. So, a couple of days before our interview together, he got very sick and couldn't speak due to sore throat. We recorded the interview around late evening. During the day, he had put extra effort to make a trip to hospital to receive injections to make sure he's able to speak.

The expectation behind communicating my beliefs is to create a good environment with a sense of collaboration. There's a fair chance for the good environment to have influenced him to absolutely make sure he's able to speak. Thinking back about it now, I should've scheduled the interview some other day proactively to make sure he's not troubling himself.

In all my interactions with my collaborators so far, because of the environment that we created, I was able to notice many such but subtle actions. A few of them had to sacrifice an hour of sleep. A few of them had to carve out time in a weekend. I could go on and on about these little stories of each collaborator. I see this as a very simple but an astonishing example. Changing our vocabulary to be concise and mindful can contribute a lot in our everyday life.

Please feel free to share your thoughts in the comments about this topic. After reading this article, I request you to use concise and mindful words all along. I'll do too :D
